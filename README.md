## Importing Libraries

Truth be told, only a few of these are absolutely necessary, but some of those libraries are there for the sake of future editing.

Primarily, we need to use the datetime library, the json library, the bs4 library, and the requests library. The others aren't as important, but in future edition 
they may be of value.
